# Vibe Coding: The New AI-Powered Workflow

In early 2025, the concept of "vibe coding" emerged, popularized by Andrej Karpathy. Instead of coding every function manually, developers now interact with AI systems, describing their goals and letting the AI handle the low-level implementation.

## Why Vibe Coding Matters
Vibe coding speeds up development cycles, reduces cognitive load, and allows engineers to focus on high-level architecture.

## Challenges
- Ensuring code quality and maintainability
- Keeping humans in the loop for critical thinking

## Final Thoughts
Vibe coding isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying their creativity and productivity.
